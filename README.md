## Welcome, to Alice Liu's website

### Self introduction

* Currently a Junior majoring in Computer Science at The City College of New York (CCNY). 
* Is expected to receive bachelor of science degree by May 2024. 
* The reason why I choose this major is because I've always been curious about the way coding works. Ever since then this field of study stuck with me just for the pure satisifaction for the things I can build and do with lines of logic and code. 
* **Interests:**

  * Reading

  * Listening to music (favorites based on current mood)

  * Traveling (want to explore Europe
 
  * Gaming (current addiction is Pixel Gun)
